              This blog was created as part of an online course for teaching people how to build fullstack websites. Using the basic languages and 
              also the primary coding languages for building websites. This website teaches students how to create user signups, logins, logouts, 
              create blogs, read and delete them. It is a process from start to finish. This website may not look like much, but there's a lot more going
              on under the hood.

              It also uses a popular front end styling framework called Bootstrap. Which is popular among all developers. It is very straightforward and clean, 
              making this not hard to learn but tedious. Since I am the instructor, and constantly learning new things myself, this website will offer more as I 
              learn it. It is much simpler than learning React or Angular for sure, but there's still a lot there if you have never done it before. If you want 
              to learn about web development, I do offer online courses or one on one.
